# The Firefighter Problem's Mathematical Programs

The `FP-pyomo.ipynb` notebook contains an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and an Integer Quadratically Constrained Program (IQCP)
for the FireFighter Problem (FP). As well as the necessary methods to run the experiments that compare the performance of both
programs with the SCIP and Gurobi solvers.

You can download the file and run it with Jupyter or Google Collaboratory to replicate the results.
